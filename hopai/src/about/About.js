              Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of technology that is changing the world at an extraordinary pace. All sectors and industries will be influenced by the impacts of AI, including governments, schools, hospitals, and courtrooms. Unfortunately, the technology is often applied and developed with little consideration for its risks and potential challenges for society. As the upcoming generation that will be most affected by this technology, it is our responsibility to promote safe AI implementation and usage.

              Given AIâ€™s ability to transcend borders and disciplines, a safe outcome can only be achievable through multidisciplinary and global collaboration. However, a gap persists between different fields of expertise, beginning in academia, that stifles possible conversations and collaborations that can lead to great innovation and creativity. Johns Hopkins University, with its international reach and diverse talent, can help to reverse this trend. And HopAI aims to support university dialogue committed to a future of safe and responsible AI practice.
